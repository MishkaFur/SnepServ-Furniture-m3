This mod makes it so that items that give house XP other than lights (Due to game limitation would stop them being used outside) or rugs (They already consume floor space) will use up an amount of the room m3 that is available, this is intended to add some additional realism to the game so that rooms are not crammed full with no ability to move in them.

Copy the respective Normal, Hard or Dr Evil folder into Mods\UserCode\ so you end up with a folder like Mods\UserCode\Furniture-m3Normal

Three versions of the mod currently exist Normal, hard (formerly called evil) and Dr Evilwith the below stats on normal furniture with Hard then being a 50% increase and Dr Evil 100%, the stats are to roughly give space for the physical item then your character to be in the area around them)
